# Design a web crawler

Purpose: write a crawler to follow links on each web page and download all the contents on the web pages.

- Perform graph traversal (BFS/DFS) starting from one or a set of initial urls

## single machine solution

BFS/DFS

what's next?

- may ask to implement a more efficient version (multithreading)
- may ask to design a more scalable system

## Bottleneck

- network bandwidth
- computation capability
- storage capability
