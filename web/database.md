# Database

**Sharding and Replication**

**Consistency and Availability**

## SQL vs. NoSQL

So, here comes the first main difference between traditional SQL and NoSQL: do you want to maintain **consistency** between all nodes, or you want to make response quickly to your client, or you want to achieve both.

- For traditional SQL(MySQL), it chooses consistency over availability.
- For NoSQL(MongoDB), it chooses availability over consistency.
